SGSMultipeerVideoMixer
======================

Receives the video from app(s) advertising using  [AVCaptureMultipeerVideoDataOutput](https://github.com/pj4533/AVCaptureMultipeerVideoDataOutput)

Supports multiple streams of video, displays in a UICollectionView.

In progress...but a fun example.

## To Do

* how many streams work?
* remove cells that disconnect
* don't use built in assistant UI - connect automagically
* look into using OGL for displaying in cells for performance
